# Bubble Game

Welcome to the Bubble Game project! This project is a simple game where players pop bubbles before the timer runs out. Additionally, it demonstrates the concepts of event bubbling and event delegation in JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bubbles:** Bubbles are dynamically generated on the screen, making each gameplay unique.
- **Scoring System:** Players earn points for popping bubbles, with the score displayed on the screen.
- **Timer:** A timer counts down the remaining time for the player to pop bubbles.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the timer runs out, and players can see their final score.

### Event Bubbling

- In the game, bubbles are created dynamically within a container element.
- When a user clicks on a bubble, the click event is triggered on the bubble itself.
- However, due to event bubbling, the click event also propagates up through all ancestor elements of the bubble, including the container element.
- This allows a single event listener attached to the container element to respond to clicks on any of its descendant bubbles.

### Event Delegation

- Instead of attaching an event listener to each individual bubble, the game utilizes event delegation.
- Event delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a parent element and then using conditionals inside the event handler to determine which child element triggered the event.
- In the Bubble Game, a single event listener is attached to the container element that holds all the bubbles.
- When a click event occurs on any bubble, it bubbles up to the container element, where the event listener is waiting.
- The event handler checks the `event.target` property to identify which bubble was clicked and then responds accordingly.

### Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Structure the webpage.
- **CSS:** Style the game interface and bubbles.
- **JavaScript:** Implement game logic, including bubble generation, scoring, timer functionality, event bubbling, and event delegation.
